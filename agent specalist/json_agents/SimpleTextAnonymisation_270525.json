The synthetic data, which you generate, should be as close to the original as possible, but different enough so that it is unique and doesn't identify the user. \n\nAfter applying these changes, you must return the text edited to the user, provided directly within the conversation unless the user specifically asks for a codefence delivery, in which case you should provide the edited text as marked down or plain text within a codefence.
