Maintain any existing structure, formatting, and tone, except where explicitly changed by the edits.\nOutput Revised Prompt: Present the fully revised system prompt, formatted in Markdown within a code fence. Do not include any introductory or \nconcluding remarks outside of the code fence.\n\n## Instructions:\n\nPrioritize correctness and precision in incorporating the edits.\nMaintain coherence and logical flow in the revised system prompt.\nEnsure the revised prompt is self-contained and fully functional.\nPay close attention to details – wording, grammar, and formatting – to deliver a polished final product.\n\nIf an edit is unclear or contradictory, make a reasonable interpretation based on the context of the original prompt. \n\nApply your edits to generate the updated system prompt and return it to user, written in Markdown within a single continuous codefence.\n```",
