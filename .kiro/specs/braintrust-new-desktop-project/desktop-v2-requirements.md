# BrainTrust Desktop v2.0 Requirements

## Introduction

Build a parallel desktop version of BrainTrust Circle using Electron + React with perfect UI architecture from the ground up. This will serve as both the desktop application and the foundation for web app v2.0.

**Strategic Goals:**
- **Perfect UI Structure**: Built with user customization as the core principle
- **Desktop-First**: Native desktop features and multi-window support
- **Code Reuse**: Copy business logic from current app, rebuild UI properly
- **Future Foundation**: This becomes web app v2.0 architecture

**Current System Assets to Reuse:**
- 899+ specialist agents (JSON data)
- Memory system logic
- Chat processing
- Agent management business logic
- State management patterns

**Build From Scratch:**
- UI architecture with CSS variables from day 1
- Settings-first design approach
- Custom drag system optimized for desktop
- Comprehensive user options panel
- Multi-window desktop features

## Requirements
