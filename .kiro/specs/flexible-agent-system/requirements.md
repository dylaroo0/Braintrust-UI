# Requirements Document

## Introduction

We are enhancing the existing Braintrust Circle application to create a flexible, scalable multi-agent AI workspace. This brownfield enhancement transforms the hardcoded 3-agent system into a dynamic agent selection system while preserving all existing functionality including the comprehensive memory system, calendar integration, and advanced search capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want a completely rebuilt Braintrust Circle application with a clean, modern architecture, so that I have a reliable foundation for multi-agent AI collaboration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting the application THEN the system SHALL load with a fresh React 19 + TypeScript codebase
2. WHEN building the app THEN the system SHALL use Vite for fast development and building
3. WHEN managing state THEN the system SHALL use Zustand for clean, predictable state management
4. WHEN integrating AI THEN the system SHALL connect to Google Gemini API without bmad dependencies
5. IF the app encounters errors THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and graceful fallbacks

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a project creator, I want to select from a diverse library of AI agents when creating a project, so that I can build the perfect team for my specific needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a new project THEN the system SHALL display an agent selection interface
2. WHEN browsing agents THEN the system SHALL show a library with diverse specializations (design, development, engineering, marketing, research, writing, analysis, etc.)
3. WHEN selecting agents THEN the system SHALL allow multiple agent selection with visual feedback
4. WHEN viewing an agent THEN the system SHALL display their role, expertise, and example capabilities
5. WHEN confirming selection THEN the system SHALL create the project with chosen agents plus the permanent Organizer

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the Organizer agent to be permanently available in every project, so that I always have project management and coordination capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating any project THEN the system SHALL automatically include the Organizer agent
2. WHEN displaying the agent interface THEN the system SHALL show the Organizer in a consistent, prominent position
3. WHEN interacting with the Organizer THEN the system SHALL provide project management, summarization, and coordination features
4. WHEN modifying project agents THEN the system SHALL prevent removal of the Organizer
5. IF the Organizer is the only agent THEN the system SHALL still provide full project functionality

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to modify my project's agent team after creation, so that I can adapt to changing project requirements and experiment with different agent combinations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing project settings THEN the system SHALL provide an agent team modification interface
2. WHEN viewing current agents THEN the system SHALL show active agents with options to add or remove
3. WHEN adding agents THEN the system SHALL integrate new agents into existing project context
4. WHEN removing agents THEN the system SHALL preserve conversation history but deactivate the agent
5. WHEN saving changes THEN the system SHALL update the project configuration and refresh the UI

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to have a clean, extensible architecture, so that new features and agents can be added easily without breaking existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN structuring the codebase THEN the system SHALL separate concerns with clear service layers, components, and state management
2. WHEN defining agents THEN the system SHALL use configuration-based definitions that can be easily extended
3. WHEN adding new agent types THEN the system SHALL support dynamic loading without code changes
4. WHEN building the app THEN the system SHALL exclude bmad dependencies from the production bundle
5. WHEN developing THEN bmad SHALL be available as a development tool to assist with building the application
