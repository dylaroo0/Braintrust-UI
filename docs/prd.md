# Product Requirements Document: Flexible Agent System Enhancement

**Project:** BrainTrust Circle - Flexible Agent System  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** February 8, 2025  
**Status:** Draft  
**Source:** Complete brownfield analysis and requirements gathering  

## Executive Summary

BrainTrust Circle is being enhanced from a hardcoded 3-agent system to a flexible, extensible multi-agent AI platform. This brownfield enhancement will transform the existing React/TypeScript application into a dynamic workspace where users can select from diverse agent libraries, create custom agents, and manage complex multi-agent workflows.

**Key Enhancement Goals:**
- Replace hardcoded agents (Designer/Developer/Engineer) with dynamic agent selection system
- Maintain Organizer as permanent "Super-Brain" orchestrator with BMad methodology integration
- Create comprehensive agent builder with templates and knowledge upload capabilities
- Build project template system for different use cases (creative writing, movie scripts, spiritual guidance, etc.)
- Implement circular workflow navigation with interlocking arrow design
- Enable community sharing of custom agents and project templates
- Support desktop version with local LLM integration
- Integrate browser extension for external AI services (ChatGPT, Grok, DeepSeek)

**Recovery Context:**
This is a brownfield project recovering from previous implementation issues while maintaining all existing functionality including the comprehensive memory system, calendar integration, advanced search, and analytics dashboard.

**Complexity Assessment:** MODERATE - Not a total rework due to existing architecture advantages:

**Current Architecture Advantages:**
- ✅ React-based - Can use Electron wrapper
- ✅ Component-based - UI components work in desktop
- ✅ Service layer - Just swap API endpoints  
- ✅ Zustand state - Works in desktop environment

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. Electron wrapper around existing React app
2. Local API service to replace Gemini calls
3. File system storage instead of web storage
4. Native OS integration (file dialogs, notifications)

**Parallel Development Strategy:**
- Build web version first (current priority)
- Desktop version shares 80% of codebase
- Different API adapters for local vs cloud LLMs
- Estimated effort: ~20-30% additional work

## Browser Extension Integration (From Chat History)

### External AI Service Integration
**Supported Services:**
- ChatGPT.com integration
- Grok participation
- DeepSeek integration
- Any web-based AI service with subscription access

**Integration Method:**
- Browser extension connects external services to conversation feed
- External AI services appear as participants in shared conversation
- Turn-based conversation flow maintained
- Seamless integration with existing agent system

**Technical Implementation:**
- Extension injects into external AI websites
- Captures responses and forwards to BrainTrust Circle
- Maintains conversation context across services
- Preserves existing agent orchestration capabilities

## Conclusion

This enhancement transforms BrainTrust Circle from a simple 3-agent system into a comprehensive multi-agent AI platform. The UI-first development approach ensures immediate visual feedback and user validation, while the modular architecture supports future expansion and customization.

The implementation maintains all existing strengths while adding powerful new capabilities for agent creation, workflow management, and project organization. The result will be a flexible, extensible platform that serves both individual users and collaborative teams.
