# BrainTrust Circle: User-Malleable Creation Tool

## Core Vision

**BrainTrust Circle** is a revolutionary user-malleable creation tool that empowers users to build their own personalized AI workspace. Unlike traditional software that forces users into rigid interfaces, BrainTrust Circle gives users complete control to design, customize, and create their ideal collaborative environment.

**The Three Pillars**: (1) One Shared Chat Feed where all specialists contribute to a single conversation, (2) Super Organizer that orchestrates everything and connects to external systems, (3) Specialist System with 899+ hyper-focused AI experts that users can select and arrange.

**Users don't just use BrainTrust Circle - they create their own version of it** through complete customization control over visual design, layout, naming, workflows, and specialist selection.
