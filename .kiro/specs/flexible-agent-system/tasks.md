# Implementation Plan

Convert the feature design into a series of prompts for a code-generation LLM that will implement each step in a test-driven manner. Prioritize best practices, incremental progress, and early testing, ensuring no big jumps in complexity at any stage. Make sure that each prompt builds on the previous prompts, and ends with wiring things together. There should be no hanging or orphaned code that isn't integrated into a previous step. Focus ONLY on tasks that involve writing, modifying, or testing code.

## Implementation Notes

**Development Approach:**

- Each task builds incrementally on previous work
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing features
- Test each component thoroughly before proceeding
- Focus on core functionality first, then enhance with advanced features

**Priority Levels:**

- **Phase 1-3**: Core functionality (MVP)
- **Phase 4-6**: Advanced features (Enhanced version)
- **Phase 7-8**: Community and desktop features (Full platform)
- **Phase 9**: Polish and optimization (Production ready)

**Testing Strategy:**

- Unit tests for all data models and services
- Component tests for UI interactions
- Integration tests for multi-component workflows
- End-to-end tests for complete user journeys

This implementation plan provides a systematic approach to building the flexible agent system while maintaining the existing Braintrust Circle functionality and ensuring each step delivers working, tested code.
