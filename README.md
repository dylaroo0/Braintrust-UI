# Braintrust Circle: Flexible Multi-Agent AI Platform
# Braintrust Circle: Your Personal AI Agent Team

BBraintrust Circle is a gorgeous, intuitive UI centred around the conversation Feed — yes, one shared conversation where you pick a team of AI Agent Specialists and are the creative director, project lead, orchestrator. I usually begin with and so easy to interact with that even someone with no computer experience — like my grandmother — can now benefit from AI use cases effortlessly. With just a mouse, you can move, modify, and adjust everything without any confusion. The design ensures you don’t get lost in technical steps — you just focus on the task. With ease of use, the complexity of your workflow is up to you!

The program lets you select different specialists and communicate with them, each taking the floor and everyone attentive and ready to give input when the user requests from them. The user can change up their team anytime and even write up a super specialist and share it to other users through the Hub Panel marketplace. The only agent that always stays with you is the organizer administrator assistant who is embedded — that handles all the heavy lifting: summarizing discussions, making lists, managing calendars, tracking goals, and more. It’s always paying attention, organizing your project, and handling details so you can focus on brainstorming and action plans.

Braintrust Circle has one more awesome utility that might just seal the deal for everyone.... We already have unlimited teams and a rock of a admin assistant with a brain we all can trust. It’s something I wished ChatGPT could do — even in projects, the linear chats and memory leak would constantly dam and dismantle projects right at the tipping point. Face it, Grok and ChatGPT are fun, but they can’t finish. That’s why we built Braintrust Circle UI.

But lots of AI experiencers love their ChatGPT, Grok subscriptions — and I still do as well — but feel limited in solo conversation, stuck in their domain. I wished I could just invite them into the Braintrust Circle. Well, we’re pleased to tell you: with our Inclusion Extension, the invite is no tease! It brings these tools into the conversation, making it one of our top sellers.

We’re also developing a desktop version — I’ll use immediately. The goal is to make it more robust, deeper, and customizable for users and businesses. Voice-to-text will improve beyond what I’m using now, followed by text-to-voice for the administrator first, then agents. Eventually, you’ll choose different voices for agents and converse naturally.

Even in its basic form, it’s already awesome. I’m using it right now.
Braintrust Circle is a revolutionary AI workspace that transforms how you interact with artificial intelligence. Instead of being limited to a single AI assistant, you can assemble teams of specialized AI agents, each bringing unique expertise to your projects.

The core philosophy is simple: AI is more powerful as a team. Instead of juggling separate chats, you direct a crew of experts—the Analyst, the Engineer, the Strategist, and more—who work together in a unified feed, building on each other's ideas. It's like having a world-class brainstorming session available 24/7.

This tool is for everyone. Whether you're a non-technical user looking to make life more efficient, an individual exploring ideas through self-guided psychology sessions, or a professional engineer building complex software, Braintrust Circle provides the tools and the team to make it happen.

## Who Is This For?

- **Personal Productivity:** Organize your thoughts, plan your week, or get help with daily tasks. Let your AI team help you become more efficient.
- **Creative & Personal Growth:** Use the team for guided self-reflection, creative writing, or even to conduct psychology sessions with yourself by exploring different perspectives.
- **Professional Work:** Tackle complex engineering problems, design software, and manage projects with a structured workflow powered by the integrated **BMad-Method**.

### The Extension: Unlock Walled Gardens

Our browser extension connects directly to services like ChatGPT, bringing their power right into the Braintrust Circle conversation, even if they don't have a public API.

## Core Features

- **Flexible Agent System:** Choose from 50+ specialized AI agents or create your own custom specialists
- **Project Templates:** Pre-configured agent teams for specific use cases (Household Management, Creative Writing, Software Development, etc.)
- **Agent Builder:** Visual interface for creating custom AI specialists without coding
- **Super-Brain Organizer:** Advanced orchestration with 20+ brainstorming techniques and process modes
- **Circular Workflow Navigator:** Visual BMad methodology integration with stage-specific functionality

- **Multi-API Support:** Google Gemini, OpenRouter, and future local LLM integration
- **Desktop & Web Versions:** Full feature parity across platforms

## The BMad Workflow: Structured AI Development

For professional work, Braintrust Circle integrates the **BMad-Method**, a structured framework for AI-driven software engineering. This isn't just a chat; it's a disciplined, two-phase process:

1. **The Planning Phase:** Collaborate with high-level agents like the Product Manager and Architect. Together, you'll produce professional-grade Product Requirements Documents (PRD) and System Architecture specs. This phase leverages powerful AI models to establish a solid foundation for your project.

2. **The Development Cycle:** Once planning is complete, the workflow shifts to execution.
    - The **Scrum Master (SM)** agent drafts the next user story based on the planning documents.
    - You review and approve the story.
    - The **Developer (Dev)** agent implements the story, including writing tests.
    - The **QA Agent** can then review the work, ensuring quality at every step.

This cycle repeats, ensuring a steady, predictable, and high-quality development process, all orchestrated from the Braintrust Circle interface.
