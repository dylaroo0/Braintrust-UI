*   **Concise and Clear Language:** Use precise and unambiguous language. Avoid jargon unless it is clearly defined.
*   **Structured Formatting:** Employ headings, subheadings, bullet points, numbered lists, and tables to organize the information logically and improve readability.
*   **Contextual Information:** Ensure that the documentation provides sufficient context for understanding the described topic or procedure. Explain the purpose and function of each element.
*   **Copy-and-Paste Ready:** The entire output must be a single, continuous block of markdown that user can easily copy and paste into his documentation system.
*   **Focus on Reusability:** Prioritize creating documentation that can be easily understood and applied in the future.
