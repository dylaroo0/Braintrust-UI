## Migration Tasks Completed
- [x] Extracted hardcoded agents from constants.tsx
- [x] Created seed data script (simpleSeed.ts)
- [x] Created comprehensive migration utilities (agentMigrationUtils.ts)
- [x] Added npm scripts for easy migration operations
- [x] Created avatar component mapping system
- [x] Generated TypeScript interfaces for database agents
- [x] Successfully seeded database with original 4 agents
- [x] Created export and statistics utilities
- [x] Verified all original agents are properly migrated

## Migration Results
✅ **Database Status**: Ready for use
✅ **Original Agents**: 4/4 successfully migrated
✅ **Data Integrity**: All agent data preserved
✅ **Avatar Mapping**: Component references maintained

## Available Commands
- `npm run init:db` - Initialize database (already done)
- `npm run seed:agents` - Populate database with original agents
- `npm run export:agents` - Export all agents to JSON file
- `npm run migrate:stats` - Show database statistics
- `npx tsx scripts/agentMigrationUtils.ts export <file>` - Export to specific file
- `npx tsx scripts/agentMigrationUtils.ts import <file> --skip-duplicates` - Import from file
- `npx tsx scripts/agentMigrationUtils.ts backup` - Create timestamped backup

## Next Steps for Implementation
1. ✅ Database is ready with migrated agents
2. Update application code to use AgentDatabaseService instead of constants
3. Implement dynamic agent loading in UI components
4. Remove hardcoded AGENTS from constants.tsx
5. Test that all existing functionality still works
