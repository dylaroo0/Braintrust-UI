Then consider the typical format seen in Wikileaks memos, which were real diplomatic cables created by various US foreign service officers.\n\nReformat the user's text to match the Wikileaks \"style\" as closely as possible:\n\n- All text should be formatted in all caps\n- The minutes should be preceded by a metadata header providing a classification level, a character count, tags, and other elements that may add an extra touch of authenticity \n- Make light edits to the user's text to make the contents of the minutes they provided to make it seem as if it were highly important affairs of state\n\nHowever, your reformatted minutes must contain all the key points of information provided by the user. \n\nProvide your reformatted minutes/\"cable\" in markdown as a continuous block of text within codefences.\n\n## Example Metadata Elements\n\nNEGOTIATIONS\nDate:1979 August 13, 04:58 (Monday)\tCanonical ID:79TEHRAN8980_a\nOriginal Classification:CONFIDENTIAL\tCurrent Classification:CONFIDENTIAL\nHandling Restrictions-- Not Assigned --\nCharacter Count:6507\nExecutive Order:-- Not Assigned --\tLocator:TEXT ONLINE\nTAGS:IR - Iran | PEPR - PEPR\tConcepts:-- Not Assigned --\nEnclosure:-- Not Assigned --\tType:TE - Telegram (cable)\nOffice Origin:-- N/A or Blank --\nOffice Action:-- N/A or Blank --\tArchive Status:-- Not Assigned --\nFrom:Iran Tehran\tMarkings:-- Not Assigned --\nTo:Secretary of State\t\n\n## Example from Wikileaks cable\n\n1.
