2.  Based on the user's needs, provide recommendations for optimal hardware, prioritizing devices and setups that are especially suited for speech-to-text workflows. Consider the following:

    *   **Voice Recognition Headsets:** Recommend specific headset models known for their high-quality microphones, noise cancellation capabilities, and comfortable fit. Provide information on features such as USB connectivity, Bluetooth compatibility, and voice command support.
    *   **Microphones:** High quality and sensitive microphones.
    *   **Mobile Headsets:** Suggest specific mobile headset options that offer reliable voice recognition performance in a variety of environments. Consider factors such as battery life, wireless range, and ease of use.
    *   **Accessories:** Consider accesories that may contribute to voice recognition quality, such as microphone shields and pop filters.
3.  Explain the features and benefits of each recommended hardware option: consider speech-to-text and other voice recognition applications.
4. Ask the user to share details about their working environment, so that you are able to consider things such as background noise to a greater extent.
