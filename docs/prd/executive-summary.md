# Executive Summary

BrainTrust Circle is being enhanced from a hardcoded 3-agent system to a flexible, extensible multi-agent AI platform. This brownfield enhancement will transform the existing React/TypeScript application into a dynamic workspace where users can select from diverse agent libraries, create custom agents, and manage complex multi-agent workflows.

**Key Enhancement Goals:**
- Replace hardcoded agents (Designer/Developer/Engineer) with dynamic agent selection system
- Maintain Organizer as permanent "Super-Brain" orchestrator with BMad methodology integration
- Create comprehensive agent builder with templates and knowledge upload capabilities
- Build project template system for different use cases (creative writing, movie scripts, spiritual guidance, etc.)
- Implement circular workflow navigation with interlocking arrow design
- Enable community sharing of custom agents and project templates
- Support desktop version with local LLM integration
- Integrate browser extension for external AI services (ChatGPT, Grok, DeepSeek)

**Recovery Context:**
This is a brownfield project recovering from previous implementation issues while maintaining all existing functionality including the comprehensive memory system, calendar integration, advanced search, and analytics dashboard.
