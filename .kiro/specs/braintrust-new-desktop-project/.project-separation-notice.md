# 🚧 PROJECT SEPARATION NOTICE

## Clear Boundaries Established

**This folder contains the NEW DESKTOP PROJECT planning and specifications.**

### Current State
- ✅ **Separated**: Clear boundaries from parent project
- ✅ **Contained**: Still within current project structure
- ✅ **Planning Phase**: Research and design specifications
- ⏳ **Waiting**: For greenfield planning completion

### Project Structure

```
CURRENT PROJECT (BrainTrust_circle-main/)
├── [Current web app code and components]
├── .kiro/specs/
│   ├── braintrust-desktop-greenfield/     # ← GREENFIELD PLANNING (ongoing)
│   └── braintrust-new-desktop-project/    # ← NEW DESKTOP PROJECT (this folder)
│       ├── README.md
│       ├── project-charter.md
│       ├── bmad-ai-collaboration-guide.md
│       └── [future planning documents]
```

### Workflow

1. **CURRENT**: Greenfield planning continues in `braintrust-desktop-greenfield/`
2. **CURRENT**: New desktop project planning happens in `braintrust-new-desktop-project/`
3. **FUTURE**: When greenfield planning is complete, this becomes the main project
4. **FUTURE**: Clean transition with full context preserved

### Key Benefits

- ✅ **Clear Separation**: No confusion between current and new project
- ✅ **Preserved Context**: All research and planning stays accessible
- ✅ **Organized Structure**: Easy to find and manage project documents
- ✅ **Future Ready**: Clean transition path when ready to implement

**This separation ensures clean project boundaries while maintaining all context and research within the current project structure.**
