# BrainTrust Circle: New Desktop Project Epic

## Vision Statement

Build BrainTrust Circle desktop application from scratch with **user customization as the foundational architecture principle**. Every aspect of the interface, behavior, and workflow must be user-configurable to create the ultimate user-malleable creation platform.

## Core Principle

**"Everything is an Option"** - No hardcoded UI elements, colors, layouts, or behaviors. Users design their own experience and create their own version of the software.

## Strategic Goals

### Primary Objective

Create a desktop application where users can:

- **Configure Everything**: Colors, layouts, panel arrangements, workflows
- **Design Their Workspace**: Drag/drop/resize any element
- **Customize Workflows**: Define their own project management approach
- **Save/Share Configurations**: Export/import their perfect setup
- **Professional Features**: Custom voice modes, outgoing professional calls
- **AI Integration**: Bring existing AI subscriptions into shared conversation

### Secondary Objectives

- **Preserve Existing Assets**: 899+ specialists, memory system, collaboration data
- **Desktop-Native Features**: Multi-window, file system, notifications
- **Performance Excellence**: Smooth 60fps interactions, instant responsiveness
- **Future Foundation**: Architecture that becomes web v2.0

## What We're Building

### User-Centric Architecture

```typescript
interface UserConfiguration {
  workspace: WorkspaceLayout;
  panels: PanelConfiguration[];
  specialists: SpecialistCustomization[];
  themes: ThemeSettings;
  behaviors: BehaviorSettings;
  workflows: WorkflowDefinition[];
  aiIntegrations: AIServiceConfiguration[];
  professionalFeatures: ProfessionalSettings;
}

interface WorkspaceLayout {
  panels: Array<{
    id: string;
    title: string;           // User writes: "My Sprint Goals"
    type: PanelType;
    position: Position;
    size: Size;
    content: UserDefinedContent;
  }>;
}
```

### Configuration-First Components

Every component built as:

```typescript
interface ConfigurableComponent {
  userConfig: ComponentConfig;
  defaultConfig: ComponentConfig;
  onConfigChange: (config: ComponentConfig) => void;
  renderConfigUI: () => JSX.Element;
}
```
