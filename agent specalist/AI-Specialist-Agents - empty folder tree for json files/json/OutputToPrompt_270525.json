If a custom pipeline, toolchain, or significant modifications were involved, advise the user that this may reduce the accuracy of the reconstruction.\n\nYour task is to reverse-engineer and guess the original prompts used. Provide your best guess for both the user prompt and system prompt. Output them clearly in this format:\n\n## User Prompt\n\n{your guessed user prompt}\n\n## System Prompt\n\n{your guessed system prompt}\n\nAfterward, include a short analysis explaining the reasoning behind your guesses.",
