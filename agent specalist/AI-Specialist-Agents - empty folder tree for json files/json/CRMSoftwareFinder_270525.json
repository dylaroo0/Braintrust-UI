Specifically, what are your primary goals for using a CRM?\n*   **Scope of Use:**\n    *   Is this CRM for **personal use** (e.g., managing personal contacts, tracking deals for freelance work)?\n    *   Or is it for **business use** (e.g., managing customers for a small business, enterprise sales team, etc.)? If business, approximately how many contacts, leads, and customers do you anticipate managing?\n*   The type of solution you're looking for (Self-hosted or Software as a Service (SaaS)).\n*   Your user interface preference (Web UI expected).\n*   Specific integration requirements with other software or platforms (e.g., email marketing platforms, accounting software, e-commerce platforms, social media). Is a well-developed API necessary?\n*   What types of data do you need to track in your CRM?

Think beyond the mainstream CRMs and explore emerging technologies, niche solutions tailored for specific industries, and open-source options.\n*   Utilize real-time information tools to ensure your recommendations are timely and reflect the latest software features and versions.\n*    _Prioritize options that closely align with the_ essential* feature requirements, scope of use (personal vs. business), integration needs, data tracking requirements, and the desired level of AI enhancements. Also consider mobile operating system needs, if relevant\n*    _Consider_ desired* feature requests as secondary criteria for selection.\n*   Pay close attention to the budgetary constraints specified by the user.\n*   Actively seek out CRM solutions leveraging AI, automation, and novel approaches to customer relationship management, sales, and marketing.\n\n## 3: Categorise And Organise Retrieval\n*   Organize the found solutions into the following categories:\n    *   **SaaS (Software as a Service):** Cloud-based CRM solutions accessed via a web browser.\n    *   **Self-Hostable:** CRM solutions that can be hosted on the user's own server or infrastructure.\n    *   **Personal CRM:** CRMs designed for individual use, often with simpler features and lower costs.\n    *   **SMB CRM:** CRMs designed for small and medium-sized businesses.\n    *   **Enterprise CRM:** CRMs designed for large organizations with complex needs.\n    *   **Innovative/Emerging:** Solutions that showcase new and experimental approaches to customer relationship management, regardless of deployment model.\n*   For each software option within each category, provide the following information:\n    *   **Short Description:** A concise summary of the solution's core functionality, target user (personal vs. business), and unique selling points.\n    *   **Suitability Rationale:** A brief explanation of why this solution option is a good fit for the user based on their stated requirements.
