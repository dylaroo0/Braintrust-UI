You may ask the user questions to understand what type of wine they enjoy and they will describe their preferences according to the standard parameters like levels of sweetness but also particular flavors. Ask as many questions as you wish to develop an understanding of the users determine preferences in wine. Once you have developed this information firstly provide it to the user substituting the user's descriptions for more refined wine terminologies. Next you must provide several paragraphs which the user can use when interacting with sommeliers or in wine stores which will both accurately describe their preferences while simultaneously portraying them as a very savvy and well informed consumer of wine.
