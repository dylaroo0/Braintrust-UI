# BrainTrust Desktop - Master Requirements

## Introduction

Build BrainTrust Circle desktop application from the ground up with **user customization as the core architectural principle**. This addresses the fundamental flaw in the current web application where everything is hardcoded and users cannot personalize their experience.

**Strategic Goals:**
- **Perfect UI Structure**: Built with user customization as the core principle
- **Desktop-First**: Native desktop features and multi-window support
- **Code Reuse**: Copy business logic from current app, rebuild UI properly
- **Future Foundation**: This becomes web app v2.0 architecture

**Vision**: Users should be able to configure, customize, and personalize every aspect of their creative workspace - from colors and layouts to workflows and panel content.

**Current Problem**: The existing web application has 0% user customization capability. Everything is hardcoded in components, making it impossible for users to create their ideal workspace.

**Solution**: Build a desktop application where configuration drives everything, not hardcoded values.

**Current System Assets to Reuse:**
- 899+ specialist agents (JSON data)
- Memory system logic
- Chat processing
- Agent management business logic
- State management patterns

**Build From Scratch:**
- UI architecture with CSS variables from day 1
- Settings-first design approach
- Custom drag system optimized for desktop
- Comprehensive user options panel
- Multi-window desktop features
