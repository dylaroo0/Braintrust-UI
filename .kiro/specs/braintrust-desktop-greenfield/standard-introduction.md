# BrainTrust Circle: User-Malleable Creation Platform

## Core Vision

Unlike traditional software that forces users into rigid interfaces, BrainTrust Circle gives users complete control to design, customize, and create their ideal collaborative environment.

*Note: The name "BrainTrust Circle" is provisional and user-configurable - users can rename their workspace to anything they prefer.*

## Foundational Architecture

### The Three Pillars (Non-Negotiable Core)

   - Specialists collaborate but maintain their specialized focus
## User as Creator Philosophy

**Users don't just use BrainTrust Circle - they create their own version of it.** The platform is designed so users can customize everything, including the name itself, making it truly their own creation tool.

### Complete Customization Control
Lots of places for you for users to upload images and anything that can contribute to their customizable experience
- **Visual Design**: Every color, font, spacing, and visual element is user-controllable
- **Layout Freedom**: Drag, drop, resize, and arrange every panel and component
- I'm not sure about how far they can go with naming rights we might have to have an actual name for our product by the end of it but everything else they can rename maybe not everything else like some words like hub we're just working on it**Naming Rights**: Users rename everything to match their terminology and preferences
- **Workflow Design**: Users define their own processes, templates, and automation
- **Specialist Selection**: Choose from 899+ specialists or create custom ones

### Template System

- **Quick StartFrom template you have to say from template**: Professional templates for immediate productivity
Maybe at the building from scratch they could decide to make it more of a music based thing Or a serious lawyer stuff where they might have to connect to an authority in that area to get stamps of approval basically to focus each of their desired projects with the actual capabilities that are out in the world Internet that can be useful to specialize per project very open that's what we have to be very OPEN! which is throw around ideas and one that's more visual one that's more you know based on mythology of the 28th century on gargoyles in Ethiopia dreams from Edgar Allan Poe-
 **Custom Creation**: Build completely custom interfaces from scratch
- **Community Sharing**: Save, share, and import workspace configurations
- **Unlimited Flexibility**: Create anything within the three-pillar framework
And to create a team template with workflow but from a existing template
## The Malleable Creation Experience

### New User Journey

When users first launch BrainTrust CircleName might be changed, they don't encounter a pre-built interface. Instead, they choose:

**Option 1: Template Selection**

- "Creative Studio" for writers, designers, content creators
- "Business Command Center" for entrepreneurs and managers
- "Development Workshop" for programmers and engineers
- "Research Laboratory" for analysts and academics
Those are just suggestions they're not written in stone and please don't repeat them exactly just make other suggestions until we have a bunch of templates and design for themremember that they have workflows in their templates as well which might have a multi different chat feeds with different specialists on them per workflow
**Option 2: Custom Builder**
I'd like to make sure that they can always change the visual aspect even if they started from a template they just might not have as many customization things but they can also load up a a Plaid picture or some grass picture or a sun setting background if they want or just choices that will be there I would be really great if we had any to like if we had a connection to like a like a painter program or open source something like Photoshop or something like that and I know it's crazy I'm just talking about all the things that are possible for extensions
- Start with a blank canvasI would imagine that there should be some basic questions prompting questions like what are you wanting to use this for or you want to use it for brainstorming wanna use it first multi workflows for final product yada yada other stuff so prompting questions would be good when they go down an area
- Design their own panel layout and arrangementchat feeds with different specialists on them per workflowPossibly the whole time is you'll be greeted by the super organizer assistant and that they'll communicate with you 'cause it should be a pretty smart AI and knowledgeable about the whole thing so they could actually have a conversation with you and make it flow easier
- Select their preferred specialist team
- Create their own naming conventions and workflows
- Build their ideal creative environment from the ground up

### Ongoing Customization
Also the ability maybe to for a user to easily create their own extension that if they were like I really want this to connect to something that already exist maybe something I made or maybe it's just something that doesn't exist in the extension marketplace yet
- **Real-time Changes**: Modifications apply immediately with live preview
- **Iterative Refinement**: Users continuously evolve their workspace
- **Context Adaptation**: Different configurations for different types of work
- **Personal Evolution**: The workspace grows and adapts with the user

oh also it's quite affordable with the API because because the one shared conversation issue will have each specialist beyond that one API 'cause it just moves to the next one and maybe we'll need to have a big stronger API for the we may need better GPT also for the OR something powerful for the organizer super assistant
**This introduction establishes that BrainTrust Circle is not just another AI tool - it's a platform for users to create their own AI-powered creative workspace, limited only by their imagination while maintaining the proven foundation of shared conversation and intelligent orchestration.**
