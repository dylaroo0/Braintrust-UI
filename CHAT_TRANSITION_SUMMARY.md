# Chat Transition Summary - Copy/Paste for New Sessions

## Project Context
**Project:** Braintrust Circle - Flexible Multi-Agent AI Platform  
**Goal:** Transform hardcoded 3-agent system into flexible, user-customizable agent library  
**Status:** Planning Complete - Ready for Implementation

## Key Architecture Decisions Made
- **Organizer as "Super Brain"**: Contains all BMad processes, brainstorming techniques, orchestration intelligence
- **Specialists as Domain Filters**: Simple, focused agents with domain-specific perspectives  
- **UI-First Development**: Build visual foundation first, then connect deeper functionality
- **Text-Based Agent Storage**: YAML/JSON for easy sharing and modification

## Implementation Approach Finalized
**Phase 1 (Tasks 1-6):** UI Foundation - Visual components and interface structure  
**Phase 2 (Tasks 7-9):** Agent System Foundation - Data models and basic functionality  
**Phase 3 (Tasks 10-25):** Advanced Features - Workflows, APIs, community features

## Essential Files Created
- `PROJECT_BRIEF.md` - Project vision and goals
- `.kiro/specs/flexible-agent-system/requirements.md` - 65 feature requirements
- `.kiro/specs/flexible-agent-system/design.md` - Technical architecture  
- `.kiro/specs/flexible-agent-system/tasks.md` - 25-task implementation plan
- `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md` - Development guidelines
- `AGENT_COMMUNICATION_LOG.md` - Multi-agent coordination board

## Current Priority
**NEXT TASK:** Task 1 - Reorganize and enhance existing UI panels
- Rename "Command Center" to customizable panel name
- Move Project Brief from Creator Hub to Organizer Panel  
- Add project title display to Organizer Panel header
- Implement customizable panel names in project settings

## Key Features Being Built
1. Dynamic Agent Selection (replace hardcoded agents)
2. Agent Builder (form-based custom agent creation)
3. Project Templates (pre-configured agent teams)
4. Circular Workflow Navigator (BMad integration)
5. Enhanced Organizer (super-brain with 20+ techniques)
6. Customizable UI (personalized panels, colors, themes)

## Technical Stack
React 19 + TypeScript + Vite + Zustand + Google Gemini API

## For New Chat Sessions
1. Reference `PROJECT_BRIEF.md` for project vision
2. Check `tasks.md` for current implementation status  
3. Update `AGENT_COMMUNICATION_LOG.md` when starting work
4. Follow UI-first development approach (visual before functional)
