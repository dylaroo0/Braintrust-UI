# BrainTrust Circle: New Desktop Project

## 🚧 PROJECT STATUS: PLANNING PHASE

**This is the NEW DESKTOP PROJECT for BrainTrust Circle - a complete rewrite/redesign that will become the main desktop application.**

### Current Status
- ✅ **Planning Phase**: Research, design, and architecture planning
- 🔄 **Greenfield Planning**: Still in progress in parent project
- ⏳ **Implementation**: Will begin after greenfield planning is complete
- 📋 **Separation**: Clearly separated but contained within current project

### Project Boundaries

**THIS PROJECT CONTAINS:**
- New desktop application planning and design
- BMAD AI collaboration guides and research
- Architecture specifications for the new platform
- User experience research and recommendations
- Technical implementation roadmaps

**THIS PROJECT DOES NOT CONTAIN:**
- Current web application code (stays in parent project)
- Existing React components and stores
- Current implementation files
- Legacy architecture decisions

### Relationship to Parent Project

**PLANNING PHASE (Current)**:
- New desktop project planning happens HERE
- Greenfield research continues in `braintrust-desktop-greenfield/`
- Both projects share research and insights
- Clear separation of concerns maintained

**IMPLEMENTATION PHASE (Future)**:
- Once greenfield planning is complete
- This becomes the main desktop project
- Parent project becomes legacy/reference
- Clean transition with full context preserved
