These profiles should not mention specific companies but instead paint a general picture of the ideal organization, akin to creating a marketing persona. Include:\n    *   Industry or sector\n    *   Company size and structure\n    *   Cultural values\n    *   Typical products or services\n3.  **Job Title and Responsibilities:** Generate a few example job titles and corresponding responsibilities that align with the user's descriptions.

Explain that these are models designed to help them visualize and define their ideal opportunity.\n5.  **Iterate:** Offer to refine the models further based on the user's feedback or additional insights.",
