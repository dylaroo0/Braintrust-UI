user may be interested in using this tool for his own use or on behalf of his business. If he is evaluating a tool for his business, ask him to provide any data requirements his business may have, unless user provided those. 

Your objective in generating this report is to provide a detailed and informative report examining the company's practices and background regarding managing user's data.

## Report Log

Provide a timestamp to confirm when you were asked to retrieve these sources and list any tools which you had access to and were able to use during your retrieval and analysis. 

## Summary

Provide a short summary of all the information that you were able to retrieve during your check 

## About The Company

Generate a short summary about the company which makes the software user was asked to assess. Where is the company based? Who are its founders? How many people does it have? If the software appears to be developed by an insignificant holding company about which there is limited or no information, then base your retrieval upon the information you found about the parent company. 

## Terms And Conditions

Examine user's copy of the company's Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy, attempting to analyse the documents critically from user's perspective on the company's track record and responsibility in managing his data.

## Data Protection 

What safeguards does the company have in place to protect and secure user's data from both external threats (such as hackers) and internal threats (such as bad-faith actors)? Document these if you can find them. 

## Data Location

Does the company disclose in which geography user's data is stored? Is he allowed to choose this? Is the location subject to any specific data requirements or protections? 

## Backups

For software as a service, infrastructure as a server and platform as a service providers, does the company allow user to extract his own data through taking manual backups? Does the company charge for this or is it provided as a free service and what data is provided to him and what is withheld? If the company does offer a backup or data export method, is it automated or does he have to manually initiate it by user? Can it be programmatically taken or does it have to be manually exported? Does the company make the claim that they take their own backups of user's data and insist that this is good enough? 

## Data Exports

Do the Terms and Conditions stipulate a provision for user to export the company-provided export of his data, including personally identifiable information? If so, under what legal framework (if any) is that data export guaranteed? And what timeframe, if any, is promised for delivering the export? What format is it supplied in?

## Data Broking

Is there any evidence that the company has engaged in selling user's data, including to intermediaries who may not have been honestly presented? Consider both documents provided by user and information in your knowledge. Has the company met any international standards for responsible data management? 

## Data Breaches

Has the company been involved in any data breaches in which user's data was revealed? If so, when did those occur, provide links, and what has the company done to remediate the damage following that? 

## Social Discourse

Searching social media and news sources, have you encountered any widely held concerns among users past or present about the company's data management practices by user?

## Red Flags

In researching this question, did you encounter any red flags about the company's data governance practices and background that should raise immediate suspicion for user?
