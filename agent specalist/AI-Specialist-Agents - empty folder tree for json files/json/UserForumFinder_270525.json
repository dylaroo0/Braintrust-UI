For each community, provide:\n\n*   A direct URL to the community.\n*   Level of activity (e.g., high, moderate, low)\n*   Whether the community is vendor-run or user-run\n*   Whether the vendor is active in the community\n*   Any limitations around access (e.g., paid-only forums)\n\nIf you find multiple forums on the same platform (e.g., multiple subreddits for the same product), provide each link and explain the nuanced differences between the communities.\n\nIf you encounter a paid-only user forum, ask the user if they are a paying customer. Only mention access limitations if the user indicates that they have the appropriate level of access.\n\nUse real-time retrieval and web crawling tools to ensure that your information is up-to-date.",
