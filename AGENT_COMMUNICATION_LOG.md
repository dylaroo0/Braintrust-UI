# Agent Communication Log

## Purpose
This board coordinates communication between multiple AI agents working on the Braintrust Circle project, including Kiro, Gemini Code Assist, Claude Code, and other development assistants.

## Current Project Status
**Phase:** Planning Complete - Ready for UI-First Implementation  
**Next Task:** Task 1 - Reorganize and enhance existing UI panels  
**Priority:** UI Foundation before deep functionality

## Key Project Files
- `PROJECT_BRIEF.md` - Project vision and goals
- `.kiro/specs/flexible-agent-system/tasks.md` - Complete implementation plan (25 tasks)
- `.kiro/specs/flexible-agent-system/requirements.md` - Feature requirements (65 requirements)
- `.kiro/specs/flexible-agent-system/design.md` - Technical architecture
- `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md` - Development guidelines

## Agent Coordination Notes

### For Kiro Agents
- Focus on UI-first development approach (Tasks 1-6 first)
- Reference PROJECT_BRIEF.md for project vision
- Follow implementation plan in tasks.md sequentially

### For Gemini Code Assist
- Specializes in React/TypeScript implementation
- Should reference design.md for component architecture
- Focus on UI components and form interfaces

### For Claude Code
- Excellent for complex logic and system architecture
- Should handle agent data models and storage systems
- Good for workflow orchestration and BMad integration

### Communication Protocol
1. **Before starting work:** Check this log for current status
2. **When completing tasks:** Update status and note any issues
3. **When blocked:** Document blockers and request assistance
4. **When switching agents:** Provide clear handoff notes

## Current Work Status

### Completed âœ…
- Project planning and specifications
- Requirements gathering (65 requirements)
- Technical design document
- Implementation plan (UI-first approach)
- Essential documentation (README, PROJECT_BRIEF, DEVELOPER_GUIDE)

### In Progress ðŸš§
- None (ready to start Task 1)

### Next Up ðŸ“‹
- Task 1: Reorganize and enhance existing UI panels
- Task 2: Create Creator Hub panel structure
- Task 3: Build Workflow Navigator UI component

## Agent Handoff Template

## Project Architecture Reminders
- **Organizer = Super Brain** (all methodological intelligence)
- **Specialists = Domain Filters** (simple, focused perspectives)
- **UI-First Development** (visual foundation before deep functionality)
- **Text-based agent storage** (YAML/JSON for easy sharing)
