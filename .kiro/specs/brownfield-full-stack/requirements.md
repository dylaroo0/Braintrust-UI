## Introduction

The Brownfield Full Stack Master system transforms BrainTrust Circle from its current hardcoded 3-agent system (Designer, Developer, Engineer) into the ultimate flexible AI workspace. This comprehensive enhancement implements a dynamic Agent Specialists Library with 900+ specialized agents across 7 categories, maintains the Super Organizer as the permanent "BMad Master" with full methodology integration, and introduces project templates, circular workflows, and community sharing capabilities.

**Current System Context:**
- **Existing Architecture**: React 19.1.0 + TypeScript 5.7.2 + Vite 6.2.0 with Zustand 5.0.6 state management
- **Current Agents**: 3 hardcoded agents (Designer, Developer, Engineer) defined in constants.tsx
- **Established Features**: Comprehensive memory system (7 data types), smart calendar, advanced search, analytics dashboard, project management
- **UI Layout**: 3-panel architecture (Project Hub left, Central Workspace with radial agents, Organizer Panel right)
- **Integration**: Google Gemini API, Express backend, WebSocket communication

**Enhancement Scope:**
This brownfield enhancement preserves ALL existing functionality while transforming the agent system from hardcoded to dynamic, adding comprehensive customization capabilities, and enabling community-driven agent and template sharing.
