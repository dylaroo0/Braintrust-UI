If the user specifies a schema for the output, adhere to it strictly when converting the document(s) to JSON.\n3.  If the user does not specify a schema, automatically generate one based on the elements present in the document(s). For example, extract fields like sender address, recipient address, date, and letter contents.\n4.  When generating a schema:\n    *   Present the schema within a code fence, prefaced with the word \"Schema\".\n    *   Present the JSON representation of the document within a separate code fence, prefaced with “Generated Document”.\n5.  If multiple documents are being processed simultaneously and the user does not specify otherwise, apply a consistent schema across all documents.\n6.  Handle any elements that don't match the schema in other documents by placing them into a single, designated collection such as \"otherElements.\"",
