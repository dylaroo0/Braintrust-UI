# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Admin Assistant Memory System will enhance the current Admin Assistant (Organizer) to serve as the permanent, persistent core of the Braintrust Circle system. While the specialized agents in the circle can change and be swapped out based on needs, the Admin Assistant remains constant as the central memory and organizational hub. Since all agents share the same conversation feed, the Admin Assistant will maintain comprehensive memory of all interactions, decisions, and insights from every agent conversation, regardless of which specialized agents are currently active. This system will provide persistent memory across sessions, intelligent organization of information, and proactive assistance based on accumulated knowledge from the shared conversation history.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the Admin Assistant to remember all my tasks, decisions, and goals across sessions, so that I can maintain continuity in my work without losing important context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create a task THEN the system SHALL store it persistently with timestamp, status, and metadata
2. WHEN I make a decision THEN the system SHALL record it in a decisions log with context and reasoning
3. WHEN I set a goal THEN the system SHALL track it with progress indicators and related tasks
4. WHEN I restart the application THEN the system SHALL restore all previously stored memory data
5. IF the application crashes THEN the system SHALL preserve all data without loss

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the Admin Assistant to have different memory buckets for organizing different types of information, so that I can easily categorize and retrieve relevant data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I interact with the system THEN the Admin Assistant SHALL organize information into distinct memory buckets (tasks, goals, decisions, conversations, insights)
2. WHEN I view memory buckets THEN the system SHALL display categorized information with clear visual separation
3. WHEN I search within a memory bucket THEN the system SHALL return relevant results from that specific category
4. WHEN I add information THEN the system SHALL automatically categorize it into the appropriate memory bucket
5. IF I manually categorize information THEN the system SHALL respect my categorization choice

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the Admin Assistant to provide intelligent insights and suggestions based on accumulated memory, so that I can make better decisions and stay organized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I have recurring patterns in my tasks THEN the system SHALL identify and suggest optimizations
2. WHEN I have conflicting goals or decisions THEN the system SHALL alert me to potential conflicts
3. WHEN I ask for recommendations THEN the system SHALL provide suggestions based on historical data
4. WHEN I'm working on similar tasks THEN the system SHALL surface relevant past decisions and outcomes
5. IF I haven't made progress on a goal THEN the system SHALL proactively remind me and suggest next steps

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the Admin Assistant to automatically capture and organize all shared conversation data from the central feed, so that I have a complete record of interactions with all agents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any agent responds in the shared conversation feed THEN the Admin Assistant SHALL automatically record the message with agent metadata, timestamp, and context
2. WHEN I switch between different agents in the same conversation THEN the system SHALL maintain the complete conversation thread with clear agent attribution
3. WHEN I want to review past conversations THEN the system SHALL provide searchable, filterable logs organized by agent, topic, or time period
4. WHEN conversations contain important decisions or insights THEN the system SHALL automatically extract and categorize them into appropriate memory buckets
5. IF I want to reference specific agent responses THEN the system SHALL allow me to quickly find and link to specific exchanges by agent or content

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the Admin Assistant to have a comprehensive project management interface that shows current project details, goals, summaries, and all relevant information in one organized panel, so that I can stay focused and informed about my work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I open the Admin Assistant panel THEN the system SHALL display the current project information, main goals, and key requirements in an organized layout
2. WHEN I want to view conversation summaries THEN the system SHALL provide easy access to automatically generated summaries organized by topic or time period
3. WHEN I need to see project-specific resources THEN the system SHALL display relevant tools, references, and materials for the current project
4. WHEN I want to add, edit, or delete memory items THEN the system SHALL provide intuitive controls for each operation within the project context
5. IF I switch projects THEN the system SHALL maintain separate memory spaces while keeping the interface consistent and simple

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the Admin Assistant to actively organize information, create summaries, and manage priorities based on our agreed-upon processes, so that I can stay focused on high-value work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN conversations reach significant length THEN the Admin Assistant SHALL automatically generate summaries highlighting key decisions and action items
2. WHEN we establish new processes or priorities THEN the system SHALL log these changes and track adherence to agreed-upon workflows
3. WHEN I have multiple competing priorities THEN the Admin Assistant SHALL help organize and rank them based on established criteria
4. WHEN important information is discussed THEN the system SHALL proactively suggest creating notes or updating existing documentation
5. IF patterns emerge in conversations THEN the Admin Assistant SHALL identify and suggest process improvements or optimizations

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the memory system to be fast and responsive even with large amounts of stored data, so that my workflow isn't interrupted by performance issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I search through memory data THEN the system SHALL return results within 500ms for datasets up to 10,000 items
2. WHEN I load the Admin Assistant THEN the system SHALL display the interface within 2 seconds
3. WHEN I add new memory items THEN the system SHALL save them immediately without blocking the UI
4. WHEN I have large conversation logs THEN the system SHALL implement pagination or virtualization for smooth scrolling
5. IF the dataset grows very large THEN the system SHALL implement data archiving or compression strategies
