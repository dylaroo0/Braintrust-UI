# AI Collaboration Strategy & Research Plan


### Project Overview for AI Collaborators

**BrainTrust Circle** is a revolutionary user-malleable creation platform where users literally build their own AI workspace. We need comprehensive research and development support to create the building blocks for this groundbreaking system.

**Core Innovation**: Users don't just use software - they create their own version of it within a proven framework (shared chat feed + Super Organizer + specialist system).


## Critical Research Areas

### 1. User-Customizable Software Analysis

**Research Target**: Programs that give users extensive customization control

**Examples to Study**:

- **VS Code**: Extension ecosystem, settings system, theme engine
- **Obsidian**: Plugin architecture, user-driven customization
- **WordPress**: Theme system, user control over appearance
- **AutoCAD**: Customizable toolbars, workspace configurations
- **Photoshop**: Workspace presets, panel arrangements
- **Unity Editor**: Layout customization, window management
- **Emacs/Vim**: Ultimate user customization examples

**Research Questions**:
- How do they store user configurations?
- What's the balance between flexibility and usability?
- How do they handle performance with extensive customization?
- What are the most popular customization features?
- How do they onboard users to customization capabilities?

### 2. Configuration Architecture Patterns

**Research Target**: How to build software that's configuration-driven

**Technical Areas**:
- **CSS Variables vs Hardcoded Styles**: Best practices for themeable interfaces
- **Component Factory Patterns**: Creating UI components from configuration
- **State Management**: Handling complex user preferences
- **Performance Optimization**: Keeping customizable interfaces fast
- **Data Persistence**: Saving and loading user configurations

### 3. Template System Design

**Research Target**: How successful template systems work

**Examples to Study**:
- **Figma Templates**: Design system templates
- **Notion Templates**: Workspace and workflow templates
- **Canva Templates**: Visual design templates
- **GitHub Templates**: Repository and project templates
- **WordPress Themes**: Complete site templates

**Research Questions**:
- What makes a template successful?
- How do users discover and choose templates?
- What's the balance between pre-built and customizable?
- How do template ecosystems develop?
