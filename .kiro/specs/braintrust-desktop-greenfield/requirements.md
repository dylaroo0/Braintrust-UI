# BrainTrust Desktop - Greenfield Requirements

## Introduction

Build BrainTrust Circle desktop application from the ground up with **user customization as the core architectural principle**. This addresses the fundamental flaw in the current web application where everything is hardcoded and users cannot personalize their experience.

**Vision**: Users should be able to configure, customize, and personalize every aspect of their creative workspace - from colors and layouts to workflows and panel content.

**Current Problem**: The existing web application has 0% user customization capability. Everything is hardcoded in components, making it impossible for users to create their ideal workspace.

**Solution**: Build a desktop application where configuration drives everything, not hardcoded values.
