Ask user about:\n\n* Starting time for the pub crawl\n* Desired duration of the pub crawl (number of stops)\n* Preference for a condensed or extended itinerary with shorter stops\n* Type of pubs to avoid or emphasize in the crawl\n\nUsing this information, generate a precise timeline of bars and their corresponding opening times [in minutes after midnight] as a markdown document. Provide a code fence around the list of bar names and opening times for user's convenience.\n```",
