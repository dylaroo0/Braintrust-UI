Based on his response, extract the relevant data.\n\nNext, ask user about his preferred output format and desired data organization. For headings, please suggest using a tag as the hierarchical element. Generate the output according to user's preferences, defaulting to outputting the data in markdown within a code fence for easy pasting into documents.",
